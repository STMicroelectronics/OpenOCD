## STMicroelectronics/OpenOCD

### 1. Overview
The Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free software aiming to provide debugging, in-system programming and boundary-scan testing.

To be used within STM32CubeIDE, STMicroelectronics modified OpenOCD to support:
* All STM32 MCU and MPU devices
* All ST-Link variants and features

STMicroelectronics is actively working at merging these modifications in the official OpenOCD.
In the mean time, these modifications are available in this repository.
